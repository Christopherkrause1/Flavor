\maketitle

In the search for new physics, processes that are supressed in the standard model and therefor especially sensitive to physics beyond the
standard model are closely examined. The $b \longrightarrow s\mu^+\mu^-$ transition is a flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) and only occurs on
loop level in feynman diagramms, which makes it susceptible for finding new processes not described in the standard model. Such a
transition occurs in the decay of a $B^0$-meson into $K^{*0}\mu^+\mu^-$ and can be described with effective field theories on a given energy scale.
Loops in the penguin diagramm can be replaced with effective couplings corresponding to the Wilson coefficients $C_i$. As they are sensitive to
new physics comparing theoretical expectations with measurements is of high interest. An effective Hamiltonian containing the
combination of the Wilson coefficients and low energy QCD operators $O_i$ with large theory uncertainties.

The angular analysis is the measurement of the decay rate of a process as a function of the angles of the final decay products. As these
measurements can give access to a large range of observables with a reduced theory uncertainty, it can help
to deduce the nature of new physics models.

Since the FCNC from a b-Quark to an s-Quark lead to the production of an $K^{*0}$ meson in the process, analysing its angular structure is
vital. The $K^{*0}$ meson is a vector with spin 1 and can be easily reconstructed at LHCb via $K^{*0} \longrightarrow K^+\pi^-$.

Tension within the standard model arises with the measurement of the $C_9$ coefficient, which is involved in loop proceses.
Its measured value deviates $3.4\sigma$ from the standard model in the last LHCb result from 2016
under the assumption that the observation can be explained solely with the shift of $Re(C_9)$.

Global fits performed by various different experiments in 2019 show 3-5$\sigma$ deviations in $Re(C_9)$ favouring a shift of the
Wilson coefficient. The new physics component of $C_{10}$ for muons, which is also involved in the loop process of the penguin diagramm, was
plotted against $C_19$ shown in figure \ref{fig:shift}.

Analysed data includes Run from LhCb in 2011 and 2012, as well as 2016 data. With an increased center of mass energy of 13 TeV in
comparison to 7 and 8 TeV of the earlier run, the added 2016 data nearly doubles the statistic reaching a
luminosity of 4.7 fb$^{-1}$.

The selection of candidates requires a small impact parameter for B mesons and a large one for the daughter products. These
requirements favours candidates coming directly from primary vertices. Particle identification is necessary to suppress peaking
backgrounds from anti B mesons and anti lambda baryons for example, as their decay products contain $\pi^-$ and $K^+$, which
leads to misidentification.

To detect the final state of the $b \longrightarrow s$ transition, the final state of $J/\psi$ has to be taken into account as
it is indistinguishable from the FCNC. Regions of interest in the $\text{d}\Gamma/q^2$ spectrum is therefor split
into three parts, which the two different charmonium states $J/\psi(1S)$ and $J/\psi(2s)$ can occupy.
The analysis is performed blind over an energy intervall of [0.1, 19] GeV$^2$ with mostly narrow and two wide bins with
the two charmonium regions from [8.0, 11.0] and [12.5, 15.0] GeV$^2$ serving as control channels.
